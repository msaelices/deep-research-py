## Features

- **Interactive Research**: Asks follow-up questions to better understand your needs
- **Depth Control**: Customize research breadth and depth
- **Web Integration**: Uses Firecrawl for reliable web content extraction
- **Smart Synthesis**: Combines multiple sources into coherent findings
- **Beautiful CLI**: Rich text interface with progress tracking
- **Markdown Reports**: Generates well-formatted research reports

## Installation

`uv tool install deep-research-py`


## Configuration

Set your API keys as environment variables:

```bash
# Required: OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key-here
# If you want to use a third-party OpenAI compliant API (e.g., OpenRouter or Gemini), add the following below:
# export OPENAI_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:1234/v1"

# Required: Firecrawl API key
export FIRECRAWL_KEY=your-firecrawl-key-here
# If you want to use your self-hosted Firecrawl, add the following below:
# FIRECRAWL_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3002"
```

## Usage

Run the research assistant:

```bash
deep-research
```

You'll be prompted to:
1. Enter your research topic
2. Set research breadth (2-10, default 4)
3. Set research depth (1-5, default 2)
4. Answer follow-up questions
5. Wait while it researches and generates a report

You can change the concurrency level by setting the `--concurrency` flag (useful if you have a high API rate limit):

```bash
deep-research --concurrency 10
```

You can get a list of available commands:

```bash
deep-research --help
```
